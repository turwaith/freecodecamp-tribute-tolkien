            <p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born in <strong>Bloemfontein</strong>, South Africa, on January 3, 1892, to
                Arthur Tolkien
                and
                Mabel Suffield Tolkien. After Arthur died from complications of rheumatic fever, Mabel settled with
                four-year-old Tolkien and his younger brother, Hilary, in the country hamlet of Sarehole, in
                <strong>Birmingham</strong>,
                England.</p>
            <p>Mabel died in 1904, and the Tolkien brothers were sent to live with a relative and in boarding homes,
                with a
                Catholic priest assuming guardianship in Birmingham. Tolkien went on to get his first-class degree at
                <strong>Exeter College</strong>, specializing in Anglo-Saxon and Germanic languages and classic
                literature. </p>

                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>Tolkien enlisted as a lieutenant in the <strong>Lancashire Fusiliers</strong> and served in World War I,
                making sure to
                continue writing as well. He fought in the <strong>Battle of the Somme</strong>, in which there were
                severe casualties,
                and
                was eventually released from duty due to illness. In the midst of his military service, he married Edith
                Bratt in 1916.</p>
            <p>Continuing his linguistic studies, Tolkien joined the faculty of the <strong>University of Leeds</strong>
                in 1920 and a few years later became a professor at <strong>Oxford University</strong>. While there he
                started a writing
                group called The
                Inklings, which counted among its members C.S. Lewis and Owen Barfield. It was also at Oxford, while
                grading
                a paper, that he spontaneously wrote a short line about "a hobbit."</p>
            <h3>Books</h3>

                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>The award-winning fantasy novel <strong>The Hobbit</strong> - about the small, furry-footed Bilbo Baggins
                and his
                adventures -
                was published in 1937, and was regarded as a children’s book, though Tolkien would state the book wasn’t
                originally intended for children. He also created more than 100 drawings to support the narrative.</p>

            <p>Over the years, while working on scholarly publications, Tolkien developed the work that would come to be
                regarded as his masterpiece - <strong>The Lord of the Rings series</strong>, partially inspired by
                ancient European
                myths,
                with its own sets of maps, lore and languages.</p>

                    </figure>
                </div>
            <p>Tolkien released part one of the series, The Fellowship of the Ring in 1954; The Two Towers and The
                Return of
                the King followed in 1955, finishing up the trilogy. The books gave readers a rich literary trove
                populated
                by elves, goblins, talking trees and all manner of fantastic creatures, including characters like the
                wizard
                Gandalf and the dwarf Gimli.</p>
            <p>While Rings had its share of critics, many reviewers and waves upon waves of general readers took to
                Tolkien’s world, causing the books to become global bestsellers, with fans forming Tolkien clubs and
                learning his fictional languages.</p>
            <h3>Death</h3>
            <p>Tolkien retired from professorial duties in 1959, going on to publish an essay and poetry collection,
                Tree
                and Leaf, and the fantasy tale Smith of Wootton Major. His wife Edith died in 1971, and Tolkien died on
                <strong>September 2, 1973</strong>, at the age of 81. He was survived by four children.</p>

                popular books in the world, having
                sold tens of millions of copies. The Rings trilogy was also adapted by director <a

            <p><strong>Tolkien's son Christopher</strong> has edited several works that weren't completed at the time of
                his father's
                death,
                including <strong>The Silmarillion and The Children of Húrin</strong>, which were published
                posthumously. The Art of the
                Hobbit was published in 2012, celebrating the novel's 75th anniversary by presenting Tolkien's original
                illustrations.</p>

            <p>Underscoring the enduring popularity of Tolkien's famed fantasy world, in November 2017, online retail
                and
                entertainment behemoth Amazon announced that it had acquired the TV rights for the book series. In its
                statement, the company revealed plans to "explore new storylines preceding Tolkien’s The Fellowship of
                the
                Ring," with the potential for a <strong>spinoff series</strong>, thereby exciting fans with the promise
                of a prequel to
                the
                familiar deeds of Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf and the rest.</p>
            <p>The author's life was the subject of the 2019 feature Tolkien, a biopic starring Nicholas Hoult and
                steeped
                with references to The Lord of the Rings.</p>
